This Application Portfolio Matrix is created based on the TIME method of assessing an applications value to the enterprise.

The TIME Chart consists of four high-level categories:

- Tolerate:The applications in this group are those that deliver business value but are not necessarily built on modern platforms or well-integrated with the companyâ€™s infrastructure.

- Invest/Innovate/Integrate: This grouping of applications shows great promise to deliver significant business value but will require the company to invest in integrating or upgrading existing infrastructure to ensure that these applications are able to function at the highest level.

- Migrate/Modernize/Remediate: This application category refers to technologies that involve software that is no longer supported or rely on a small group of human resources with specialized knowledge.

- Eliminate: In addition to redundant applications, you may find in your scoring that some of the applications in your inventory have little to no business value, or that the costs of operating the application far outweigh the results delivered. In these situations, such applications should be marked for elimination.
